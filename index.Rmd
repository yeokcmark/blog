Welcome! And thank you for stopping by. This blog was created using [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and written entirely in R Studio. Hopefully, it will be a growing showcase of all projects related to R which I embark on. <br> <br>

15 Jan 2023: I’ve finally graduated from SMU’s Certified Data Analytics (R) Specialist course. I made this as a present for Prof Roh.

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Clear global environment ----
rm(list = ls())
# Load packages ----
library(tidyverse)
library(imager) #package for image processing
library(gganimate)
library(randomcoloR) #generate random colors

#set.seed(20240114)

# Read in coordinates of photo ----
df <- read_csv("prof_rohV2_coord.csv")
df_length <- nrow(df)
df <-
  df%>% 
  rename(order = n) %>% 
  mutate(order = rep(1:72, length.out = df_length))
# 72 represents what WAS the max sparkles per cluster. In the next revision 
# this will be the first item to fix. Unfortunately, this project was assembled
# 3 parts (photo, fireworks, thank you) in a very short time

# Find min max x,y of photo to determine subsequent position of thank you
# and fireworks elements.
xmin <- min(df$x)
xmax <- max(df$x)
ymin <- min(-df$y)
ymax <- max(-df$y)


# Creating fireworks ----
# Generate data for fireworks

i <- 10 # number of clusters
s <- 50 # number of sparkles per center

# generate 10,000 random dots per cluster
dots <-
  tibble(x = runif(n = 10000*i, min = xmin, max = xmax),
         y = runif(n = 10000*i, min = ymax, max = 100)) #adjust relative positioning
# s * i gives number of dots per display


# generate color table. c controls color, cluster_n is the cluster number
# you could always specify your own colors
color_table <-
  tibble(cluster_n = 1:i,
         c = randomColor(i)
         )
# sample s*i number of sparkles per cluster of fireworks
sparkles <-
  tibble(x = sample(dots$x, s*i),
         y = sample(dots$y, s*i)
         )
# use kmeans algorithm to partition sparkles to each center
km <- kmeans(sparkles,
             centers = i,
             iter.max = 50,
             nstart = 1)

# Information on centers of each fireworks cluster
center <- 
  tibble(c_x = km$centers[,1],
         c_y = km$centers[,2]) %>% 
  mutate(cluster_n = 1:n())

# Information on cluster allocation ie: tells you which sparkle is assigned to each cluster
cluster <- 
  tibble(cluster_n = km$cluster)

# generate the fireworks by assembling all plot info
fireworks <-
  bind_cols(sparkles, cluster) %>% # sparkles assigned to cluster
  left_join(., color_table, by = "cluster_n") %>% # color assigned to cluster
  left_join(., center, by = "cluster_n") %>% # center assigned to cluster
  # next 4 lines of code have to do with sequencing of sparkles for animation
  # i wanted sparkles closest to each center to start together in the animation
  mutate(distance = sqrt((x - c_x)^2 + (y - c_y)^2)) %>% #calculate distance between sparkle and center
  group_by(cluster_n) %>% 
  arrange(distance) %>% #arrange by ascending distance
  mutate(order = 1:n()) %>% # ordering for animation sequence
  ungroup()


# Read in coordinates of thank you ----
df_t <- read_csv("thankyou.csv")
df_t_length <- nrow(df_t)
df_t <-
