Will I give up on this one? Only time will tell…\r\nBut in the short time that I’ve been learning R, I’ve grown to love the ecosystem, and creating a post within Distill is quite easy. When I first considered blogging within the R ecosystem, I gave blogdown/Hugo a try. But I found it difficult to set up.\r\nThis blog is hosted on Netlify (for FREE), and configured to deploy from Github. There were some teething pains, and it took me a while to figure out Github. Maybe one day, I shall write a dummy’s dummy-guide. But in the meantime, themockup and The Distillery provided sufficient resources to get me started. Finally, I modified the site theme from Infrequently Frequentist so thanks a bunch!\r\nHow I got started with R?\r\nI started learning R in September 2023, so as of writing this blog, my experience with R spans barely 3 months. With all the talk about “big data” and “machine learning”, I was curious about the field of data science. In addition to that, I had skillsfuture credits that were expiring. A bit of googling later, I signed up for the Certified Data Analytics (R) Specialist offered by SMU Academy.\r\nWhy R? Everyone seemed to be talking about python, so I decided to go “against the herd” and do something different. Why this particular class? Firstly, it was open enrollment, meaning it didn’t have much/any pre-requisites to meet. Secondly, I read the instructor’s bio and realized that we both graduated from the same University. It was a done deal!\r\nA little about me\r\n\r\nI’m approaching 50, so if I can learn R, it’s proof that you can teach an old dog new tricks! Wooof! I graduated from an Ivy-League university some 30 years ago, and have a bit of programming background in Java and HTML. My work experience has been in tourism, hotel development, and finance.\r\nI’m married with 2 grown-up children, love swimming and have supported Arsenal FC since George Graham was a manager. My favorite Arsenal player is the “non-flying dutchman”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
